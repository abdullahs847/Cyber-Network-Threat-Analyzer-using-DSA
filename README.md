# Cyber-Network-Threat-Analyzer-using-DSA
Semester project for Data Structures and Algorithms (CS221) focused on designing and implementing a graph-based cybersecurity analyzer using C++. The project applies fundamental DSA concepts such as graphs, queues, stacks, and hash maps to model computer networks, detect potential security threats, and analyze attack propagation paths.
